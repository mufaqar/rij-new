## Getting Started

Install and run the development server:

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
npm run dev
```

To get Storyblok to work in browser, we have to run a proxy server to have https on localhost.
Follow one of the guides below to set up the proxy server:
Guide for macOS: https://www.storyblok.com/faq/setup-dev-server-https-proxy
Guide for Windows: https://www.storyblok.com/faq/setup-dev-server-https-windows

Run proxy to have https on localhost:

```bash
npm run proxy
```

Open [https://localhost:3010](https://localhost:3010) with your browser to see the result.
